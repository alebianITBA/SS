## Systems Simulations
This project consists of the soruce code for a PA for the Systems Simulations course at ITBA on 2016.
It uses the Cell Index Method to make the search of potential neighbours of each particle more efficient and the Off-Lattice model to generate a simulation of particles moving within set boundaries based on [this paper](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~jadbabai/ESE680/Vicsek_SPP.pdf).
